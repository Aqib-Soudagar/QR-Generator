# QR-Code-Generator
A QR code generator is a web application that generates QR (Quick Response) codes, which are scannable codes that can hold text, contact information, website URLs, or other data. Users input the desired content, and the QR code generator converts it into a unique QR code that can be scanned by smartphones or QR code readers.
