# QR-Generator
A QR code generator is an online tool that creates QR (Quick Response) codes, which are scannable codes that store information such as website URLs, contact details, text, or other data. Users input the desired content, and the QR generator converts it into a unique QR code that can be scanned by smartphones or QR code readers.
